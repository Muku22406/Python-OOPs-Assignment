        "- **Abstraction** and **Encapsulation** are both fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), but they serve different purposes. **Abstraction** focuses on hiding implementation details and exposing only the necessary functionalities, making complex systems easier to understand and use. It is achieved through abstract classes and interfaces, where the user interacts with high-level methods without worrying about how they are implemented. For example, when driving a car, you use the steering wheel to turn, but you don’t need to know how the internal mechanics work. **Encapsulation**, on the other hand, is about data protection and restricting direct access to the internal state of an object. It is implemented using access modifiers (like private, protected, and public) to control how data is accessed and modified. This ensures that sensitive data is not altered unintentionally, and it is only accessible through well-defined methods (getters and setters). For instance, in a car’s engine system, you cannot directly manipulate the internal components but can control them using an ignition key or accelerator. In summary, **abstraction** simplifies complexity by focusing on **what** an object does, while **encapsulation** enhances security by controlling **how** data is accessed and modified.\n"

It allows child classes to access parent methods without explicitly naming the parent class, making the code more flexible and easier to modify. One of the most common use cases of `super()` is in the `__init__` method, where it initializes attributes from the parent class, avoiding code duplication. Additionally, `super()` plays a crucial role in multiple inheritance by following Python’s Method Resolution Order (MRO), ensuring that the correct method is called in complex inheritance structures. This is especially useful when dealing with diamond inheritance patterns, as it prevents redundant calls to the same method. By using `super()`, developers can write cleaner, more maintainable object-oriented code that adapts well to changes in parent classes."

It is used to **release resources**, such as closing files, network connections, or freeing memory before an object is deleted. The significance of `__del__` lies in its ability to ensure proper cleanup of resources, preventing memory leaks in applications that deal with external resources. However, it should be used with caution because Python’s **garbage collector** automatically manages memory, and relying too much on `__del__` can lead to issues like delayed object deletion or circular reference problems. In general, explicit resource management using **context managers (`with` statement)** is preferred over `__del__` for better control and predictability."
